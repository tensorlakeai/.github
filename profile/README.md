# Indexify

Indexify is a compute framework for building and serving multi-stage agentic workflows, which can be parallized and run on one or more machines. If you are building RAG/LLM Applications or Agents which depend on LLMs consuming data extracted from documents or video/audio, Indexify can help you to build pipelines which keeps your indexes updated in real time as data changes.
